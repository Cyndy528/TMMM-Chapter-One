It's a book written a long time ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mythicalmanmonth00fred" target="_blank">It's so important that it is available for **FREE** online!</a>.

## Why are we making you read it?

At one point I asked a senior engineer if they could recommend me any reading which will make me a better developer and creator. They responded by saying:

> Have you read Mythical Man Month yet?

I hadn't and responded with something snarky. That night I purchased the book and read it. To this day it is a book which I often pull new work lessons from.

We believe that as new developers or those working in technical trades you'll gain insight into your career.

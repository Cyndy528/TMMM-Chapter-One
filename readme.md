It's a book written a long time ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/mythicalmanmonth00fred" target="_blank">It's so important that it is available for **FREE** online!</a>

## Why are we making you read it?

At one point I asked a senior engineer if they could recommend me any reading which will make me a better developer and creator. They responded by saying:

> Have you read Mythical Man-Month yet?

I hadn't, and responded with something snarky. That night I purchased the book and read it. To this day it is a book which I often pull new work lessons from.

We believe that as new developers or those working in technical trades, this book will give you insight into what it's like to work on a development team.

## Homework

**Read the first chapter of The Mythical Man Month.**

To get started, fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine. Create a new file called `answers.md`, and respond to the following questions with your thoughts after reading the first chapter:

1. What does the quote on the first page mean to you?
2. Does every software project succeed?
3. What are some reasons why a project may fail to meet deadlines?
4. What is fun about programming?
5. What is not fun about programming?
6. How much time does the last bug take to fix?

Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
